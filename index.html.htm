<p>My father is the <b><i><u>pillar</u></i></b> of my family.He works hard everyday and
give us comfortable life.He is a <b>responsible</b> and <b>caring</b> 
person who always puts the needs of our family first.I admire his <i>strenght,
honesty,</i>and <i>the way he handles every situation calmly.</i>In his
free time,he likes to share stories from his childhood,and we all enjoy
listening to them</p>
<br>
<h2>
MY mother is the <b><i><u>heart</u></i></b> of our home.She takes care of
everything---<b>cooking,cleaning,and looking after each one of us with so 
much love.</b>She is <i>kind,gentle,</i>and <i>always ready to help.</i>
Whenever i have a problem or feel upset,I know i can talk to her ad feels better.
Her <i>hugs</i> are the <i>warmest comfort</i> i know.</p>

<p>My younger sister is full of energy and joy.She is curious,always asking
question.Even though she can be a little naughty at times,she brings so much<i>
happiness into our lives.</i>I enjoy spending time with her schoolwork.</p>
<br>
<h2>
<p>My younger brother is the youngest in the family and the most <b>mischievous.</b>
He is <i>playful</i> and always <i>running around the house,making us laugh with his
silly jokes.</i>Though he is small,he has a big heart and shares everything he has.
I love playing games with him and watching cartoons together.</p>
