<h2>
<p><font color="black">My mother,<b>S.Tasneem Banu,</b>is the most <i>loving</i> and <i>caring</i>
person in my life.She is a <b>Housewife,</b>and she plays a very important role in our family.Even
though she does not go out to work,the work she does at home is priceless and keeps our family happy
and strong.
<br>
<P>From early morning to late at night,my mother is always busy taking care of us.She cooks delicious food,
keeps the house clean,helps us with our studies,and makes sure everyone is comfortable and happy.
She never complains,no matter how tired she is.Her love is <i>unconditional,</i>and her <i>patience</i>
is something i truly admire.
<br>
<P>And my <b>Mom</b> is also very kind and helpful.She teaches me to be <b><i>honest,respectful,and 
caring towards others.</b></i>She always listens to our problems and gives the best advice.Her warm <i>smile
and gentle words can brighten anyone's day.</i>
<br>
<P>Even though she is housewife,I believe her work is as valuable as any job outsides the home.She is the backbone
of our family and the reason why our home feels like a safe and happy place
<b><i>"All that i am,or hope to be,I owe to my angel mom"
